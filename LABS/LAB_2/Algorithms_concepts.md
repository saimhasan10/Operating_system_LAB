# Algorithms Concepts

## Shortest_Remaining_Time_First(SRTF)

### Inputs:

- Process IDs
- Arrival Time
- Burst Time

### Outputs:

- Gantt Chart: Shows the execution order based on arrival time.
- Turnaround Time (TAT): For each process.
- Waiting Time (WT): For each process.
- Average TAT and WT.
- start time
- end time

## Round_Robin(RR)

### Inputs:

- Process IDs
- Arrival Time = 0
- Burst Time

### Outputs:

- Gantt Chart: Shows the execution order based on arrival time.
- Turnaround Time (TAT): For each process.
- Waiting Time (WT): For each process.
- Average TAT and WT.
- start time
- end time
